For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
A business recommendation and review site, akin to Yelp, which will focus on promotion and
raising visibility of small, minority-, women-, and differently-abled-persons owned and run businesses.
The site should help guide community and customer support and interest to small, diverse, independent businesses
and orgs run/owned by the listed groups. A service of this type would be helpful for the conscious consumer: the person 
who is invested in buying/supporting as locally as is possible and building stable financial networks for
often-disenfranchised or overlooked groups within their communities. 

### Features
Search:  User/potential customer can do a word search of the site for a needed good or service.

Customer Login:  Customer uses discrete user identity to log in, create a profile page, and write reviews.

Generate Transaction Code:  The customer, having completed a transaction with their chosen business, receives a code
which allows them access to a feedback form for that particular business. This will hopefully help
to guard against the types of abuses that are rampant in some customer feedback systems.

Get Rebate:  Customer can access a rebate code for participating businesses after completing 2 transactions and writing 2 reviews.
This should help to promote customer loyalty and repeat business.

Business Opt-out:  Functionality allows business owners themselves to opt out of participation
in the service as desired, and at no cost.
